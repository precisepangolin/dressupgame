# Dress up game
 
A dress up game made for desktop in WPF. So far mostly a WIP.

## Current features
* Placeholder images for the doll and items
* Clothing and hair/facial features can be dragged over the doll
* Draggable items stay within window boundaries
* Hair has a front element that goes over the doll and a back element that stays behind the doll; more items like these can be easily added

## TODOs
* Replace placeholder images with better and bigger ones
* More items and improved aesthetics
* Add option to export doll image

## Screenshots
* Before moving
